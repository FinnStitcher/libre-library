# Libre Library

Libre Library is a search engine built on top of the Google Books API. Search for your favorite books and save them to your personal, digital library, accessible only to you. LL can be used to keep track of what books you own, what books you've read, or what books you'd like to read someday!

Libre Library is available live at https://libre-library-fs.herokuapp.com/.
